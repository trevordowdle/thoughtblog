We live in perilous times, as a Member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I am aquainted with the contempt that many express towards the Church and it's members.

Scorning practices such as abstaining from coffee and alcohol, and missionary service.  To mocking beliefs such as mankinds potential for godhood.  All of these remarks while prevelant, always struck me as mindless, and had little if any detrimental affects to my faith.

In contrast, there's another thread of dirision against The Church which I've experienced to be especially harmful in it's potential to sow seeds of doubt regarding one's faith.  This is an anti movement, one that assaults the credibility of The Church with the goal to lead away and or weaken the testimony of members of the church.

They do this by degrading the character of church leaders past and present, waging a war on it's history and teachings.  And as I've personally experienced, a movement that's bent on using mischaracterization and deception.  One that aims to paint The Church in the worst possible light, ethics aside.

This is not a genuinely honest movement that wants to help people to escape from some perceived injustice or organization that they believe is causing harm.  If that were the case the arguments would stand on their own merits.  Instead deceit abounds, as I will demonstrate.

As I contemplated how these anti arguments affected me and my faith, I realized the importance of dicerning truth from error and doing your homework.  After doing my research and exposing these arguments for what they are, the thought came to me just how dangerous and imprudent it would be for me, or any other member to take these at face value.  To put their trust in man, instead of God.  

That goes for all men, I believe there is a tendency to put men called of God such as apostles and prophets up on a pedestal nearing perfection in this church.  Forgetting that these are still men, subject to faults and mistakes like the rest of us.  Many of the attacks against the church prey on false assumptions that many of us within the church are prone to make.
