<p>
In late 2019 I participated in a message board that has a lot of discussion on collegiate running.  Brigham Young University has a very competitive, national relevant running program and as such the team is a topic of conversation.  Unsurprisingly, the team and university with their affiliation to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saint attract a lot of derrogatory voices against anything related to the Church.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally when someone was willing to engage in actual conversation, instead of only peddling mindless drivel against the Church, I would step in to defend my beliefs.
</p>
<p>Here are some excerpts from the conversations in one thread</p>
<hr />
#### Bring ‘em Young

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
If I have told lies, please point out to me what I’ve said that is a lie. Based on what I’ve posted, I do know what beliefs are consistent with Mormon doctrine. I spent decades of my life as a believer until I 
couldn’t reconcile some of the very basic questions that I’ve posted here. I then became aware of the 
damage that the church’s beliefs cause to many people, and I left the Mormon church.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
I never said that I have questions about what Mormons believe. I already know what Mormons believe. I 
question how Mormons can reconcile their beliefs once they learn the non-watered down version of their 
history and doctrine that is not taught to them each Sunday. I’ve found that in many cases, non-Mormons 
know more about the unsavory aspects of Mormon history than believing Mormons.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
I once again look forward to any defender of the Mormon faith to point out anything that I have posted here as a lie. I will rescind anything that I’ve said that is untrue.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
The BYU Law School is named after J. Reuben Clark who said “If we have the truth, it cannot be harmed by investigation. If we have not the truth, it ought to be harmed.” If anything I’ve said is offensive to 
believing Mormons, perhaps instead of saying things like “this isn’t the venue” and calling me a liar, 
you should examine why the history of your church and your beliefs makes you uncomfortable.

<p style="color:#4f8aff">Right off the bat, I can point out issues with said statement. In a nutshell you say BYU researches discovered that Joseph Smith's translation of the Bible was actually plagiarism. As far as I know only two researchers were involved with said research paper. Both researchers would have needed to conclude that Joseph Smith was involved in plagiarism for your statement to be factually correct. In reality, such a statement can only be attributed to one of the researchers.</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">That researcher was a student at BYU, the other, a professor for the university did not come to the same conclusions. That aside, i'd like to hear from you. You look forward to this, but it's a little boring for me just responding to canned accusations. Lets hear your analysis, your reasoning's and conclusions. Let your independent voice come through.</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">In your own words make the best case you can for plagiarism, include evidence, be as thorough as you can. Make the case for plagiarism by Joseph Smith in said endeavour.</p>

You have not pointed out a misleading statement from me. If you are referring to my statement on coffee, I’ll still stand by my statement as truthful. Consuming coffee can disqualify you from heaven in the eyes of Mormons.

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
I’ll also stand by my statement that BYU researchers have discovered that polygamist Joe’s translation of the Bible was a plagiarism of Adam Clarke’s Bible commentary. The research paper says, “our research has revealed that the number of parallels between Smith’s translation and Adam Clarke’s biblical commentary are simply too numerous and explicit to posit happenstance or coincidental overlap. The parallels between the two texts number into the hundreds.” The research paper uses words like “direct borrowing” and “open reliance” when describing how Joseph Smith used the Bible commentary. Joseph relied on the Bible commentary to create his own “translation” of the Bible and then passed the ideas off as his own; or at least as revelation. That is the definition of plagiarism.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
I’m not sure where you are getting the idea that the two researchers didn’t agree. Why would the BYU professor agree to publish the work if he didn’t agree with the student researcher who was the co-author?

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
You also shouldn’t be surprised about Joseph Smith’s lack of ability to be able to “translate.” He has a proven track record of being dishonest about the texts he has created

Humans regardless of belief are not exempt from making erroneous assumptions. You yourself have made a plethora of erroneous assumptions that the said research into Joseph's translation amounts to findings of plagiarism.

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
“our research has revealed that the number of parallels between Smith’s translation and Adam Clarke’s biblical commentary are simply too numerous and explicit to posit happenstance or coincidental overlap. The parallels between the two texts number into the hundreds.”
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
All this research proves or brings to light is that Joseph Smith relied on and used Adam Clarke's biblical commentary when compiling his translation.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
This research does challenge certain assumptions that may have been made about the translation in the past, mainly that Joseph Smith used direct revelation for all the changes. All this does is shed new light on the matter. Who's to say that Joseph Smith wasn't guided to use Adam Clarke's commentary because it was inspired work? If anything, it gives more credence to the translation as not only does it have Joseph's stamp of approval, it also shows that Joseph wasn't the only one to recognize deficiencies in the accepted translated version of the bible. It's a paradigm shift.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
The research paper does not contain the word plagiarism. So accusations of plagiarism are your own and are based on assumption and are not attributed to the paper despite your insistence.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Assumption 1 - Joseph had to rely on God and himself alone while doing the translation.<br /><br /> 

Assumption 2 - Joseph translated the bible in the same way he did with the Book of Mormon from one language to another. As far as I can find Joseph never had access to the original bible manuscripts, so that would not be the case here.<br /><br />  

Assumption 3 - Joseph tried to hide or cover up and hide the fact that he used other sources in the endevour.<br /><br /> 

Assumption 4 - Now that it has been verified that Joseph used other sources, all unaccounted for annotations must have come directly from other sources as well.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Erroneous assumptions such as these, and or believing that others have similar assumptions is foolhardy.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
The burden of proof is still on you, show me evidence of plagiarism.

### Conversation with another anti

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
Joseph Smith said that the moon was inhabited by people six feet tall who dressed like Quakers and lived to be 1,000 years old (Source: Journal of Oliver B. Huntington, a devout Mormon contemporary of Joseph Smith; copy at Utah State Historical Society, Vol. 2, p. 166).
</p>
</div>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
A source, this is good. From what I can find there is only one source to corroborate this quote being directly from Joseph Smith. And in the journal account from 1881 (decades after Joseph's death) he is not relating a first hand account but rather an account from another man. That's the only source attributing such a statement to Joseph Smith. Far from conclusive.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Something interesting to note, the idea of life on the moon seems outrageous and outlandish to us now days. Because science and time has provided us with overwhelming evidence to the contrary. But that was not always the case. Especially in the early 1800's.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #e2e2e2;padding: 20px;border-radius: 4px;font-style: italic;">
<p>
Library of congress (loc.gov)
In scientific circles the notion that there could be sophisticated life on the moon was quite plausible. John Hershel's father, astronomer William Hershel, had worked to document life on the moon. In 1778 William Hershel believed he had observed lunar towns, but by the 1830's observations of the moon were making it less likely that there were lunar civilizations.
</p>

<p>
Popular science writers continued to insist that the moon was inhabited. In 1838, Thomas Dick, a popular writer on Christianity, philosophy and astronomy wrote ,"the Moon is inhabited by rational creatures, and that its surface is more or less covered with vegetation not dissimilar to our own Earth" and that from a telescope one can observe "great artificial works in the Moon erected by the lunarians." Similarly, the 1846 textbook The Young Astronomer External explained, "It is the general opinion of astronomers that the Moon is inhabited." In popular writing throughout the century authors suggested that life on the moon was practically a fact.
</p>
</div>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
So some of the best and most respected astronomers and scientists of the time affirmed the notion of life on the moon. This widespread belief backed by science certainly infiltrated Mormon culture and produced some excitement as it matched up with revelation affirming life on other worlds. So speculations and overzealous discussion might be expected. There are sources of leaders of the church expressing their belief of life on the moon in that time period. But I can find no evidence linking that belief as a result of the revealed word of God.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Care to engage in discussions relating to any other sources on the topic?
</p>

<hr>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
But those astronomers weren't claiming to be the "prophet of God." Basically what you are saying is that since there were other con men running around claiming that they could find buried treasure, then Smith's lies about finding buried golden plates can be forgiven. Since there were scientists running around claiming that there were Quakers living on the moon, then Smith's lies about getting "revelations from God" about men on the moon can be forgiven. You are saying that either God is a liar or Smith was a liar.
</p>
<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
You are quick to dismiss the witnesses to Smith's outrageous claims, but wholeheartedly believe the witnesses affidavits in the preface to the BOM, several of whom came clean and admitted that they were lying. Also, why should Smith need witnesses in the first place? The word of God should be good enough. Using the manufactured testimony of witnesses is a well used MO by con men to bolster their credibility.
</p>
<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
Smith was also proven to be a liar when he claimed to translate the Book of Abraham, which is part of the mormon doctrinal foundation. In reality, Smith purchased some Egyptian scrolls from an itinerant traveling salesman. In the same manner as he allegedly translated the so-called golden plates, he said that he translated the scrolls. Many years after the Rosetta Stone was discovered, Smith's scrolls were examined by mormon scholars and mainstream scholars. The unanimous verdict was that Smith lied, the scrolls were not the Book of Abraham, they were part of the Egyptian Book of the Dead.
</p>
<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
Since Smith lied about his entirely false translation of the Book of Abraham, there is no reason to believe that any part of the BOM is legitimate. And since Smith lied about the BOM, there is no reason to believe that any of his self-proclaimed "revelations from God" are anything but his lies. And there is no reason to believe that any "revelations" from any of the so-called mormon "prophets" are true. The entire mormon "church" is built upon lie after lie, lies which have been shown to be lies.
</p>
<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
Smith was nothing more than a proven liar and tawdry con man. Every single one of his "revelations" have been proven false.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
I have said nothing of the sort, only that there is no evidence of "men on the moon" being linked to "revelations from God" within the church. All we have is one man's assertion of what another man told him Joseph Smith said. Lest you assume such a wild idea could only have come from within the church, I demonstrated how it was actually a popular and scientifically held belief at the time.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Your first sentence indicates to me that you are operating under the assumption that a "Prophet of God" should be infallible and always operate under direct inspiration from God and never be subject to human err. However the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and examples from Joseph Smith's life show that this is not the case.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Here is just one example from the early days of the Church, Jesus's first apostles:
</p>

<div style="background-color: #e2e2e2;padding: 20px;border-radius: 4px;font-style: italic;">
<p>godcannotbecontained.blogspot.com:</p>
<p>
In his letter to the churches of Galatia, Paul reveals that he angrily confronted Peter over his hypocritical conduct toward Gentile Christians when in the presence of Jewish Christians (Galatians 2:11-14). Apparently he had to remind Peter (himself an apostle, author of Scripture and acknowledged leader within the Church - some say the first Pope) that Christians are reconciled to God through faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the Mosaic Law (verses 15-16). I don't know about you, but it certainly sounds to me like Peter was in error regarding this matter of the faith (at least, that seems to be what Paul is saying)!
</p>
</div>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
See more examples in the new testament:
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
If scripture so readily demonstrates that Peter and other apostles called by Christ in his day had struggles in the early days of the church, didn't always have constant intervention and revelation from God to correct them, but instead were subject to human fallacies and err. Why would you assume that early leaders and apostles in Joseph Smith's day should be exempt from the same?
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Alright the BOM, this is very cut and dry there is clarity here:
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
We know from Joseph Smiths direct account that he was led by God to find and translate the scripture records making up the BOM. There's no question as to how the Book of Mormon came to pass, Joseph Smith spells it out for us so there is no need to make assumptions. As someone seeking to discredit the church, It makes a lot of sense to focus on disproving the Book of Mormon, for a detractor it's easy to see and believe that the Book of Mormon is Joseph's biggest con. After all, that's a whole lot of material that he would either had to of made up himself, and or had to of stolen/used content from somewhere else. And since Joseph affirms that the entire record came by the power of God if you can discredit that assertion you can discredit the man the Church.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
I think the BOM is a great place to focus, I don't think there can be any ambiguity here.

Embarrassment: No archaeological evidence
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Archeologists are just discovering how much they don't know about ancient America.
As many of their prior findings and assumptions are being proven wrong with the use of new lidar Technology and the findings and application of the technology is still in it's infancy.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #e2e2e2;padding: 20px;border-radius: 4px;font-style: italic;">
<p>National Geographic News:</p>
<p>Surprising Insights</p>

<p>
“LiDAR is revolutionizing archaeology the way the Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized astronomy,” said Francisco Estrada-Belli, a Tulane University archaeologist and National Geographic Explorer. “We’ll need 100 years to go through all [the data] and really understand what we’re seeing.”
</p>

<p>
Already, though, the survey has yielded surprising insights into settlement patterns, inter-urban connectivity, and militarization in the Maya Lowlands. At its peak in the Maya classic period (approximately A.D. 250–900), the civilization covered an area about twice the size of medieval England, but it was far more densely populated.
</p>

<p>
“Most people had been comfortable with population estimates of around 5 million,” said Estrada-Belli, who directs a multi-disciplinary archaeological project at Holmul, Guatemala. “With this new data it’s no longer unreasonable to think that there were 10 to 15 million people there—including many living in low-lying, swampy areas that many of us had thought uninhabitable.”
</p>

<p>
Virtually all the Mayan cities were connected by causeways wide enough to suggest that they were heavily trafficked and used for trade and other forms of regional interaction. These highways were elevated to allow easy passage even during rainy seasons. In a part of the world where there is usually too much or too little precipitation, the flow of water was meticulously planned and controlled via canals, dikes, and reservoirs.
</p>

<p>
Among the most surprising findings was the ubiquity of defensive walls, ramparts, terraces, and fortresses. “Warfare wasn’t only happening toward the end of the civilization,” said Garrison. “It was large-scale and systematic, and it endured over many years.”
</p>
</div>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
These new insights, already show at least one civilization in the America's that existed in Book of Mormon times with a sophistication and population scale more consistent with the Book of Mormon narrative than previously believed.

How did the gold plates get from Guatemala to a hill in New York? Did Moroni ride a horse to get to New York? Oh wait, horses hadn’t arrived in the American continent yet. They did, however, exist in the Book of Mormon.
</p>
<hr>
<p style="color:#4f8aff">
I don’t know that the plates went from Guatemala to New York. You said that.
</p>
<p style="color:#4f8aff">
I’m saying that those relying on archeological evidence as a crux against the validity of the Book of Mormon should think again. Everything archeologists thought they knew about the Mayan society has just been turned on it’s head. Archeology efforts and conclusions of the past are now in question. LiDAR technology is a game changer.
</p>
<hr>
<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
Actually what you said was, “These new insights, already show at least one civilization in the America’s that existed in Book of Mormon times with a sophistication and population scale more consistent with the Book of Mormon narrative than previously believed.”
</p>
<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
Either Moroni found a way to carry the heavy plates of gold from Guatemala to New York, or the Mayan civilization in Guatemala that you are referring to had nothing to do with the civilization described in Book of Mormon.
</p>
<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
He could have also rode an elephant and pulled a chariot. Those things exist in the Book of Mormon. Although they didn’t actually exist on the American continent during Book of Mormon times.
</p>
<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
You’ll also have to find a creative way to explain away DNA evidence that shows natives of the American continent migrated from Asia and not from Jerusalem as the Book of Mormon teaches.

Did you process what I said about being careful not to rest your claims on ever evolving and changing archaeological evidence? That includes things like horses and DNA.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
You must not be informed, science is a fast moving and constantly evolving. And there is evidence of horses existing in Pre Columbian america.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #e2e2e2;padding: 20px;border-radius: 4px;font-style: italic;">
<p>Yes world, there were horses in Native culture before the settlers came:</p>
<p>https://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/news/yes-world-there-were-horses-in-native-culture-before-the-settlers-came-JGqPrqLmZk-3ka-IBqNWiQ/</p>

<p>
The original theory accepted by the Western World was that there were no horses in the Americas prior to Columbus’ arrival in 1492. The Western World concluded that all horses of Native American peoples were, therefore, descendants of horses brought from overseas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>This theory was forced to change, however, after paleontology pioneer Joseph Leidy discovered horse skeletons embedded in American soil in the 1830s.</strong> They were dated to be the oldest of any found in the world. According to Collin’s dissertation, the American scientific community was outraged and questioned his findings. Ultimately, they were forced to accept the evidence he provided.
</p>

<p>
At this point, <strong>the narrative shifted to say that horses originated in the Americas, but were later completely extinguished due to the last Ice Age period</strong> (roughly 13,000 to 11,000 years ago). <strong>Thus, the Spanish were still believed at that time to have “reintroduced” the horse to the Americas in the late 1400s.</strong>
</p>

<p>
But on account of Collin’s work, <strong>the theory is being beckoned to change once again to say that Native Americans always had a sustained relationship with the horse.</strong> In the dissertation, <strong>Collin compiles a list of fossil and DNA evidence which dates after this supposed “extinction” period.</strong>
</p>

<p>
“<strong>The wonderful thing is that we now have Western technology that can provide very accurate dates</strong>,” said Collin in a recent interview. “Many studies show that these horses were present after the very same Ice Age that supposedly wiped out them all out. So, the most compelling data to support the Native narrative is actually from a lot of the western scientific measurements that are coming out.”
</p>
</div>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
So a conclusion that "horses hadn't arrived in north america yet." might be just a little outdated...
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
There is also recent evidence linking DNA from Native American's in north america to Jewish populations.

Scientific and archaeology findings are not set in stone, this is easy to see as the narrative is constantly changing as new research and discoveries continue to challenge prior preconceptions. To rely on such as if it was set in stone is to err.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
Congrats on finding a creative way to get around the DNA and horse issue by finding a poorly article that contradicts most of the scientific community. If you are going to believe in the articles that you've posted, you also have to concede that Mormon scripture stating the earth is 6,000 years old is erroneous. You can't have it both ways.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
After you come up with a way to reconcile those issues, you still have the major issue of Joseph Smith being a proven convicted fraud. If you defend him, you are defending a man that while in his late 30's married multiple teenage girls and openly lied about it. Are you willing to stoop to that level?

        So even if you believe the garbage that BYU funded Fairmormon publishes...
    </p>
</div>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
I find it Ironic that in the same breath you share a publication from "The Salt Lake Messenger" a decidedly and unabashedly anti-mormon publication.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Reading down into that same publication we find the following information regarding the authors:
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
"During the past year we have been charged with being "unChristian," misquoting material and being unethical in our writings. We have completed our response to these charges and have published it in the new edition of The Lucifer-God Doctrine. All those who have been affected by these charges against us should take the time to read our side of the story before drawing any conclusions."
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
So instead of addressing these charges within the publication, they presumably expect their audience to buy a new edition of their book so they can read their side of the story there...
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Further down:
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
"At the present time we find ourselves running a little short (we have not had a pay check for six weeks). We are not desperate, however, because a man has given us some land. Although we could sell it, at the present time the market is so poor that we would have to let it go at a greatly reduced price. Our temporary shortage of funds probably stems from the fact that we have not raised the prices of most of our books over the past several years and that we have been putting out larger issues of the Salt Lake City Messenger and sending them to a greater number of people. We have been mailing out about 14,000 copies to those on our mailing list and giving out thousands more at a later time. Many people feel that this is a very valuable service, but less than 4% of those who receive the newsletter make donations. Fortunately, however, many others buy materials, and this helps us to meet our obligations. Some people have felt that if they do not send support, they should not remain on the mailing list. We do not feel this way at all. In fact, we desire that everyone who is blessed by the Messenger should remain on the list. It does not make any difference whether they can give contributions or buy our material. The most important thing is that the information is disseminated to those who need it."
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Clearly these people relied heavily on funds generated from their anti-mormon material for their sustenance... So finding the truth is clearly not their only incentive. Rather, tickling the ears of their decidedly anti-mormon audience helped them provide for themselves monetarily.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
The Authors: Jerald and Sandra Tanner
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Here are some opinions about them from professional, unbiased sources.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Lawrence Foster, a non-Mormon historian of Mormon history, has offered a mixed assessment of the Tanners and their work. On the negative side, Foster has written that, until the Tanners "are prepared to abide by accepted standards of scholarly behavior and common courtesy, they can expect little sympathy from serious historians." He criticized them for "a holier-than-thou stance, refusing to be fair in applying the same debate standard of absolute rectitude that they demand of Mormonism to their own actions, writings, and beliefs.... The Tanners seem to be playing a skillful shell game in which the premises for judgment are conveniently shifted so that the conclusion is always the same—negative."
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
On a more positive note, Foster says that some of the Tanners' "research and analysis... would do credit to any professional historian." He credits them with being "more than simply gadflies" and says that their work has helped stimulate serious Mormon scholarship.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
D. Michael Quinn, a historian and former member of the LDS Church, takes issue with the Tanners' work. He noted that "although the most conscientious and honest researcher can overlook pertinent sources of information, the repeated omissions of evidence by the Tanners suggest an intentional avoidance of sources that modify or refute their caustic interpretation of Mormon history."
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
So you can state that "fairmormon" is garbage. But I have demonstrated "The Salt Lake Messenger" to be garbage or at best an unreliable and uncredible publication.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
I invite you to demonstrate the same with your claim of "garbage".
</p>

<hr>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
I can understand why you take issue with Jerald and Sandra Tanner. Their work uncovered multiple contradicting accounts of Joseph Smith’s “first vision.” The Tanners are the ones who discovered that Joseph Fielding Smith removed a page of Joseph Smith’s letterbook that contained the only version of the account in Joseph Smith’s own handwriting. The account in the letter book contradicted the version of the “first vision” that is still taught in the Mormon church today. Joseph Fielding Smith locked the account in a safe for decades, but because of the discoveries the Tanners made, Joseph Fielding was forced to tape it back in the letterbook.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
Also, LDS historian D. Michael Quinn is a former Mormon. However, he is still a believing Mormon. He was excommunicated from the church for being gay. You should read some of his books. You’ll learn a lot about your Church’s history. Early “Mormonism and the Magic Workd View” will teach you more about Joseph Smith’s treasure hunting and the ways that he committed fraud. “The Mormon Hierarchy” will teach you about the Mormon Church’s violent history. It also highlights the ways the church is amassing wealth while contributing very little to humanitarian causes.

I thought that I had already proven that if you believe that the earth’s temporal existence will be longer than 7,000 years, your belief contradicts Mormon doctrine. I can rehash it all again though.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
If you’d like my interpretation of D&C 77, I think Joseph Smith is just making stuff up and pretending like he has some gift of being able to interpret the book of Revelations.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
However, your Mormon prophets seem to believe that D&C 77 is saying exactly what it is saying, the earth will undergo 7,000 years of temporal existence.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
In referring to D&C 77, Joseph Fielding Smith said “here is a definite statement by revelation to us that the earth will go through 7,000 years of temporal existence.” He also said “we can hardly be justified in trying to harmonize the days of creation with extended periods of millions of years according to the reckoning of the so-called scientists.”
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
If your personal beliefs are different than Mormon doctrine, you would most likely have to be a geriatric white male to be able to change Mormon doctrine (it’s also much easier if you are directly related to Joseph Smith or Brigham Young. For some reason, God chooses a lot their family members to be apostles and prophets).
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
If you aren’t willing to conform your interpretation of Mormon scripture to actual Mormon doctrine, you could start your own religion. However, if you follow Joseph Smith’s example of marrying multiple teenage wives, claiming to be able to find buried treasure, creating your own bank, printing your own currency, anointing yourself “King on Earth”, and then start walking around town in a military uniform with a sword in your hand (yes, Joseph did all of these thing), you’ll likely end up in prison or committed to a psyche ward.

Thanks again, this doesn't change the fact that a professional historian, someone who is openly critical of the faith as you have just demonstrated by a description of his books. Could see through and easily identify the Tanner's willingness to omit and ignore evidence in the name of furthering and bolstering their agenda. Maybe I will check out one of his books, might be worth my time if he's honest and fair in his approach. If he is, I know enough to know that things wont be as cut and dry as you portray.

No, this is news to me. And sounds like a new claim altogether. What I remember you claiming is that Mormon scripture is in err, because it states that the earth is only 6,000 years old which is wildly incompatible with scientific evidence dating the earth back billions of years.

Let's examine why you are wrong about Mormon scripture stating that the earth is 6,000 years old. Let use Joseph Fielding Smith's commentary which you referenced but left out some pertinent commentary.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
In referring to D&C 77 verse 6, Joseph Fielding Smith said “here is a definite statement by revelation to us that the earth will go through 7,000 years of temporal existence. <strong>Temporal, by all interpretations, means passing, temporary or mortal. This, then, has reference to the earth in its fallen state</strong>....”
</p>

<hr>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
Exactly! If Adam was the first of mankind on earth approximately 6,000 years ago, all of the archeological articles you’ve posted are wrong because they talk about animals and people who died way before 6,000 years ago! Mormons believe death did not occur on earth before Adam and Eve partook of the fruit. How can you reconcile Adam being the first man on earth and death not occurring until 6,000 years ago with all scientific evidence pointing to your church’s doctrine being wrong?
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
Your logic baffles me.

The account was troubling enough to a Joseph Fielding to cause him to hide it from the world for decades! It’s the only account in Joseph Smith’s hand retiring and it bothered Joseph Fielding so much that he cut it out of Joseph Smith’s journal for hell sakes.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
If you can’t see any contradictions, I can point them out to you. Joseph Smith’s original version never states that he saw God, and never states that Joseph was commanded to “restore” Christ’s church. Instead, Joseph Smith describes the experience as a prayer he offered for forgiveness of his sins and him having a vision of Christ and receiving forgiveness of his sins. You can’t honestly claim that there aren’t contradictions in the two versions of the story.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
Once again, if the version written in Joseph Smith’s handwriting wasn’t troubling to Mormons, why would Joseph Fielding hide it?

That first sentence is the most correct thing you have stated, and for once I can't find fault with it. It certainly seems that Joseph Fielding Smith had some concerns with the account and didn't want it out in the public to be scrutinized.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Reading the first hand account and noting the differences and ambiguities from the widely known account Joseph Smith published, I can see why the account would be troubling. Releasing the account would give anti mormons plenty of fodder and catch members off guard who didn't know of if it's existence.

And to your second "contradiction" you pointed out, I can't find anywhere in Joseph's published account of the "first vision" where he states he was commanded to "restore" Christ's church. Just that the Lord forbade him to join with any existing church and the account from his journal has similar sentiments. Not seeing anything you pinpointed as mutually exclusive or contradictory. I can point out some plausible reasons why there might be some differences though.

By "polishing" the 1842 account you mean changing who he actually had a vision of, I'll agree with you. Joseph Smith did a lot of "polishing" of his stories throughout his life. Joseph wasn't talking to any audiences in his 1832 account, he was writing in his own personal journal. There is no reason for him to forget to mention that God visited him if that had really happened.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
Additionally, Joseph Smith taught a trinitarian view of the Godhead for many years after he organized the Mormon Church. He didn't believe that God and Jesus were separate beings in 1832. He even taught trinitarian doctrine in the Book of Mormon. When the Book of Mormon was first published, it stated that Mary was the mother of God. The original version of the book was later changed to read that Mary was the mother of the son of God. There are still a lot of trinitarian teachings that were left in the Book of Mormon. It wasn't until many years after he had supposedly had the "first vision" that he started teaching that God and Jesus were distinct and separate beings. Once his doctrine changed, his version of his vision also changed.
