Let me introduce you to someone I'll name <span style="color:#ff6c4f">Anti</span>, I am jumping into the middle of a conversation we had.  Anti is undecidely against the Church and is working to discredit the Church and shame it's members.

<hr />

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
If I have told lies, please point out to me what I’ve said that is a lie. Based on what I’ve posted, I do know what beliefs are consistent with Mormon doctrine. I spent decades of my life as a believer until I 
couldn’t reconcile some of the very basic questions that I’ve posted here. I then became aware of the 
damage that the church’s beliefs cause to many people, and I left the Mormon church.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
I never said that I have questions about what Mormons believe. I already know what Mormons believe. I 
question how Mormons can reconcile their beliefs once they learn the non-watered down version of their 
history and doctrine that is not taught to them each Sunday. I’ve found that in many cases, non-Mormons 
know more about the unsavory aspects of Mormon history than believing Mormons.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
I once again look forward to any defender of the Mormon faith to point out anything that I have posted here as a lie. I will rescind anything that I’ve said that is untrue.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
The BYU Law School is named after J. Reuben Clark who said “If we have the truth, it cannot be harmed by investigation. If we have not the truth, it ought to be harmed.” If anything I’ve said is offensive to 
believing Mormons, perhaps instead of saying things like “this isn’t the venue” and calling me a liar, 
you should examine why the history of your church and your beliefs makes you uncomfortable.

<p style="color:#4f8aff">Well said.</p>

    <span style="color:#ff6c4f">I once again look forward to any defender of the Mormon faith to point out anything that I have posted here as a lie.</span>
</div>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">I've already pointed a misleading statement. And as far as I know, one of the definitions of a lie is to create a false and misleading impression.</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">lets examine another claim. But instead of me taking time to refute an unsubstantiated claim, I think the onus should be on you.</p>

<div style="background-color: #e2e2e2;padding: 20px;border-radius: 4px;font-style: italic;">
    <span style="color:#ff6c4f">BYU researchers have actually recently discovered that Joseph Smith’s “translation” of the Bible was actually just a plagiarism of a popular bible commentary that Adam Clarke published in 1831.</span>
</div>


<p style="color:#4f8aff">Right off the bat, I can point out issues with said statement. In a nutshell you say BYU researches discovered that Joseph Smith's translation of the Bible was actually plagiarism. As far as I know only two researchers were involved with said research paper. Both researchers would have needed to conclude that Joseph Smith was involved in plagiarism for your statement to be factually correct. In reality, such a statement can only be attributed to one of the researchers.</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">That researcher was a student at BYU, the other, a professor for the university did not come to the same conclusions. That aside, i'd like to hear from you. You look forward to this, but it's a little boring for me just responding to canned accusations. Lets hear your analysis, your reasoning's and conclusions. Let your independent voice come through.</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">In your own words make the best case you can for plagiarism, include evidence, be as thorough as you can. Make the case for plagiarism by Joseph Smith in said endeavour.</p>

<hr>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
You have not pointed out a misleading statement from me. If you are referring to my statement on coffee, I’ll still stand by my statement as truthful. Consuming coffee can disqualify you from heaven in the eyes of Mormons.
</p>


<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
I’ll also stand by my statement that BYU researchers have discovered that polygamist Joe’s translation of the Bible was a plagiarism of Adam Clarke’s Bible commentary. The research paper says, “our research has revealed that the number of parallels between Smith’s translation and Adam Clarke’s biblical commentary are simply too numerous and explicit to posit happenstance or coincidental overlap. The parallels between the two texts number into the hundreds.” The research paper uses words like “direct borrowing” and “open reliance” when describing how Joseph Smith used the Bible commentary. Joseph relied on the Bible commentary to create his own “translation” of the Bible and then passed the ideas off as his own; or at least as revelation. That is the definition of plagiarism.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
I’m not sure where you are getting the idea that the two researchers didn’t agree. Why would the BYU professor agree to publish the work if he didn’t agree with the student researcher who was the co-author?
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
You also shouldn’t be surprised about Joseph Smith’s lack of ability to be able to “translate.” He has a proven track record of being dishonest about the texts he has created
