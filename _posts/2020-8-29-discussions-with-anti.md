Let me introduce you to someone I'll name <span style="color:#ff6c4f">Anti</span>, I am jumping into the middle of a conversation we had.  Anti is undecidely against the Church and is working to discredit the Church and shame it's members.

<hr />

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
If I have told lies, please point out to me what I’ve said that is a lie. Based on what I’ve posted, I do know what beliefs are consistent with Mormon doctrine. I spent decades of my life as a believer until I 
couldn’t reconcile some of the very basic questions that I’ve posted here. I then became aware of the 
damage that the church’s beliefs cause to many people, and I left the Mormon church.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
I never said that I have questions about what Mormons believe. I already know what Mormons believe. I 
question how Mormons can reconcile their beliefs once they learn the non-watered down version of their 
history and doctrine that is not taught to them each Sunday. I’ve found that in many cases, non-Mormons 
know more about the unsavory aspects of Mormon history than believing Mormons.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
I once again look forward to any defender of the Mormon faith to point out anything that I have posted here as a lie. I will rescind anything that I’ve said that is untrue.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
The BYU Law School is named after J. Reuben Clark who said “If we have the truth, it cannot be harmed by investigation. If we have not the truth, it ought to be harmed.” If anything I’ve said is offensive to 
believing Mormons, perhaps instead of saying things like “this isn’t the venue” and calling me a liar, 
you should examine why the history of your church and your beliefs makes you uncomfortable.

<p style="color:#4f8aff">Well said.</p>

    <span style="color:#ff6c4f">I once again look forward to any defender of the Mormon faith to point out anything that I have posted here as a lie.</span>
</div>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">I've already pointed a misleading statement. And as far as I know, one of the definitions of a lie is to create a false and misleading impression.</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">lets examine another claim. But instead of me taking time to refute an unsubstantiated claim, I think the onus should be on you.</p>

<div style="background-color: #e2e2e2;padding: 20px;border-radius: 4px;font-style: italic;">
    <span style="color:#ff6c4f">BYU researchers have actually recently discovered that Joseph Smith’s “translation” of the Bible was actually just a plagiarism of a popular bible commentary that Adam Clarke published in 1831.</span>
</div>


<p style="color:#4f8aff">Right off the bat, I can point out issues with said statement. In a nutshell you say BYU researches discovered that Joseph Smith's translation of the Bible was actually plagiarism. As far as I know only two researchers were involved with said research paper. Both researchers would have needed to conclude that Joseph Smith was involved in plagiarism for your statement to be factually correct. In reality, such a statement can only be attributed to one of the researchers.</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">That researcher was a student at BYU, the other, a professor for the university did not come to the same conclusions. That aside, i'd like to hear from you. You look forward to this, but it's a little boring for me just responding to canned accusations. Lets hear your analysis, your reasoning's and conclusions. Let your independent voice come through.</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">In your own words make the best case you can for plagiarism, include evidence, be as thorough as you can. Make the case for plagiarism by Joseph Smith in said endeavour.</p>

<hr>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
You have not pointed out a misleading statement from me. If you are referring to my statement on coffee, I’ll still stand by my statement as truthful. Consuming coffee can disqualify you from heaven in the eyes of Mormons.
</p>


<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
I’ll also stand by my statement that BYU researchers have discovered that polygamist Joe’s translation of the Bible was a plagiarism of Adam Clarke’s Bible commentary. The research paper says, “our research has revealed that the number of parallels between Smith’s translation and Adam Clarke’s biblical commentary are simply too numerous and explicit to posit happenstance or coincidental overlap. The parallels between the two texts number into the hundreds.” The research paper uses words like “direct borrowing” and “open reliance” when describing how Joseph Smith used the Bible commentary. Joseph relied on the Bible commentary to create his own “translation” of the Bible and then passed the ideas off as his own; or at least as revelation. That is the definition of plagiarism.
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
I’m not sure where you are getting the idea that the two researchers didn’t agree. Why would the BYU professor agree to publish the work if he didn’t agree with the student researcher who was the co-author?
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
You also shouldn’t be surprised about Joseph Smith’s lack of ability to be able to “translate.” He has a proven track record of being dishonest about the texts he has created
</p>

Humans regardless of belief are not exempt from making erroneous assumptions. You yourself have made a plethora of erroneous assumptions that the said research into Joseph's translation amounts to findings of plagiarism.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
“our research has revealed that the number of parallels between Smith’s translation and Adam Clarke’s biblical commentary are simply too numerous and explicit to posit happenstance or coincidental overlap. The parallels between the two texts number into the hundreds.”
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
All this research proves or brings to light is that Joseph Smith relied on and used Adam Clarke's biblical commentary when compiling his translation.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
This research does challenge certain assumptions that may have been made about the translation in the past, mainly that Joseph Smith used direct revelation for all the changes. All this does is shed new light on the matter. Who's to say that Joseph Smith wasn't guided to use Adam Clarke's commentary because it was inspired work? If anything, it gives more credence to the translation as not only does it have Joseph's stamp of approval, it also shows that Joseph wasn't the only one to recognize deficiencies in the accepted translated version of the bible. It's a paradigm shift.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
The research paper does not contain the word plagiarism. So accusations of plagiarism are your own and are based on assumption and are not attributed to the paper despite your insistence.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Assumption 1 - Joseph had to rely on God and himself alone while doing the translation.<br /><br /> 

Assumption 2 - Joseph translated the bible in the same way he did with the Book of Mormon from one language to another. As far as I can find Joseph never had access to the original bible manuscripts, so that would not be the case here.<br /><br />  

Assumption 3 - Joseph tried to hide or cover up and hide the fact that he used other sources in the endevour.<br /><br /> 

Assumption 4 - Now that it has been verified that Joseph used other sources, all unaccounted for annotations must have come directly from other sources as well.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Erroneous assumptions such as these, and or believing that others have similar assumptions is foolhardy.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
The burden of proof is still on you, show me evidence of plagiarism.

### Conversation with another anti

<div style="background-color: #e2e2e2;padding: 20px;border-radius: 4px;font-style: italic;">
<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
JS in the prison of hell wrote:
Joseph Smith said that the moon was inhabited by people six feet tall who dressed like Quakers and lived to be 1,000 years old (Source: Journal of Oliver B. Huntington, a devout Mormon contemporary of Joseph Smith; copy at Utah State Historical Society, Vol. 2, p. 166).
</p>
</div>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
A source, this is good. From what I can find there is only one source to corroborate this quote being directly from Joseph Smith. And in the journal account from 1881 (decades after Joseph's death) he is not relating a first hand account but rather an account from another man. That's the only source attributing such a statement to Joseph Smith. Far from conclusive.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Something interesting to note, the idea of life on the moon seems outrageous and outlandish to us now days. Because science and time has provided us with overwhelming evidence to the contrary. But that was not always the case. Especially in the early 1800's.
</p>

<div style="background-color: #e2e2e2;padding: 20px;border-radius: 4px;font-style: italic;">
<p>
Library of congress (loc.gov)
In scientific circles the notion that there could be sophisticated life on the moon was quite plausible. John Hershel's father, astronomer William Hershel, had worked to document life on the moon. In 1778 William Hershel believed he had observed lunar towns, but by the 1830's observations of the moon were making it less likely that there were lunar civilizations.
</p>

<p>
Popular science writers continued to insist that the moon was inhabited. In 1838, Thomas Dick, a popular writer on Christianity, philosophy and astronomy wrote ,"the Moon is inhabited by rational creatures, and that its surface is more or less covered with vegetation not dissimilar to our own Earth" and that from a telescope one can observe "great artificial works in the Moon erected by the lunarians." Similarly, the 1846 textbook The Young Astronomer External explained, "It is the general opinion of astronomers that the Moon is inhabited." In popular writing throughout the century authors suggested that life on the moon was practically a fact.
</p>
</div>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
So some of the best and most respected astronomers and scientists of the time affirmed the notion of life on the moon. This widespread belief backed by science certainly infiltrated Mormon culture and produced some excitement as it matched up with revelation affirming life on other worlds. So speculations and overzealous discussion might be expected. There are sources of leaders of the church expressing their belief of life on the moon in that time period. But I can find no evidence linking that belief as a result of the revealed word of God.
</p>

<p style="color:#4f8aff">
Care to engage in discussions relating to any other sources on the topic?
</p>

<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
But those astronomers weren't claiming to be the "prophet of God." Basically what you are saying is that since there were other con men running around claiming that they could find buried treasure, then Smith's lies about finding buried golden plates can be forgiven. Since there were scientists running around claiming that there were Quakers living on the moon, then Smith's lies about getting "revelations from God" about men on the moon can be forgiven. You are saying that either God is a liar or Smith was a liar.
</p>
<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
You are quick to dismiss the witnesses to Smith's outrageous claims, but wholeheartedly believe the witnesses affidavits in the preface to the BOM, several of whom came clean and admitted that they were lying. Also, why should Smith need witnesses in the first place? The word of God should be good enough. Using the manufactured testimony of witnesses is a well used MO by con men to bolster their credibility.
</p>
<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
Smith was also proven to be a liar when he claimed to translate the Book of Abraham, which is part of the mormon doctrinal foundation. In reality, Smith purchased some Egyptian scrolls from an itinerant traveling salesman. In the same manner as he allegedly translated the so-called golden plates, he said that he translated the scrolls. Many years after the Rosetta Stone was discovered, Smith's scrolls were examined by mormon scholars and mainstream scholars. The unanimous verdict was that Smith lied, the scrolls were not the Book of Abraham, they were part of the Egyptian Book of the Dead.
</p>
<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
Since Smith lied about his entirely false translation of the Book of Abraham, there is no reason to believe that any part of the BOM is legitimate. And since Smith lied about the BOM, there is no reason to believe that any of his self-proclaimed "revelations from God" are anything but his lies. And there is no reason to believe that any "revelations" from any of the so-called mormon "prophets" are true. The entire mormon "church" is built upon lie after lie, lies which have been shown to be lies.
</p>
<p style="color:#ff6c4f">
Smith was nothing more than a proven liar and tawdry con man. Every single one of his "revelations" have been proven false.
</p>
